# Activity Summary for 5/4/2025

## 8:30:47 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `handlers.ts` file, focusing on mock API handlers for testing purposes.  The initial version (7:42:10 AM) contained extensive mock handlers for various API endpoints (`/api/login`, `/api/parents`, `/api/students`, `/api/drivers`, `/api/buses`, `/api/stops`, `/api/routes`, `/api/schedules`, `/api/zones`), using MSW and Zod for schema validation and Faker for data generation.  Subsequent changes (7:42:30 AM, 7:42:43 AM, 7:43:02 AM, 7:43:08 AM, 7:43:20 AM) progressively reduced the number of handlers, finally leaving only handlers for `/api/login` and `/api/buses`, and removing the delete handlers.  A significant change occurred at 7:46:59 AM, switching from `msw/rest` to `msw/http`, simplifying the handler structure.  The code remained consistent concerning the `/api/buses` handler, generating 15 mock buses.  The changes to `handlers.ts` show a refinement process, likely focusing the test suite on specific API functionalities.


At 7:48:14 AM, `browser.ts` was created to set up the MSW worker using the `handlers` from `handlers.ts`.


The `main.tsx` file (8:15:54 AM) sets up the React application with React Query for data fetching, routing using React Router, and theme and auth providers.


Changes to the `App.tsx` file between 8:18:09 AM and 8:18:40 AM reflect a significant restructuring of the routing configuration. The initial version had simple routes, while the final version utilized lazy loading for improved performance, private routes (`PrivateRoutes`, `AdminRoutes`), public routes (`PublicRoutes`), and layouts (`AuthLayout`, `MainLayout`, `AdminLayout`) to enhance code organization and user experience.


`ThemeContext.tsx` (8:16:27 AM) and `useAuth.tsx` (8:21:31 AM - 8:22:14 AM) show initial versions that were progressively refined, `useAuth` evolving to a function that returns a string.


Other files such as `PrivateRoutes.tsx`, `PublicRoutes.tsx`, `AdminRoutes.tsx`, `MainLayout.tsx`, `AdminLayout.tsx`, and `AuthLayout.tsx` (between 8:23:44 AM and 8:28:18 AM) implement the routing and layout components used in the `App.tsx` file. The `Header.tsx` component was created at 8:30:29 AM, likely to manage user authentication and navigation aspects.
